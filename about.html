                <h2>Kiera</h2>
                <p>Kiera is a graduate student, which means that most of her time is spent researching or teaching.
                    Her background is in math, but she has found herself doing more computer science than math lately.
                    Currently, her research interests are in the limitations of AI/LLMs and anything related to education,
                    especially gamification.</p>
                <p>In any free time she has, she enjoys playing games with friends or doing some creative writing.</p>

                <h2>Zelda</h2>
                <p>Zelda is an orange cat. Despite her orange-ness she has managed to figure out how to open doors and drawers
                    on her own. She is a large cat, weighing in at 20 pounds, though she was a healthy weight at 13 pounds.
                    She is very long.</p>
                <p>Zelda enjoys laying in laps, receiving pets, and sitting in front of computer monitors.</p>
